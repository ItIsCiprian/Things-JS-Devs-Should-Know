## Introduction
The goal of this tutorial is to help developers master the complexities of modern frontend development tools and techniques. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to understand the core concepts behind the leading frameworks, how state management works, and how to apply these skills to build efficient, scalable web applications.

## Setup Instructions
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version)
- NPM or Yarn
- Code Editor (e.g., VSCode)

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/modern-frontend-frameworks.git
cd modern-frontend-frameworks
```

## Modern Frontend Frameworks
### React
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

#### Getting Started with React
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Vue.js
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building UIs and single-page applications.

#### Getting Started with Vue.js
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
<div id="app">
  {{ message }}
</div>
<script>
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    message: 'Hello Vue!'
  }
});
</script>
```

### Angular
Angular is a platform and framework for building client-side single-page applications using HTML and TypeScript.

#### Getting Started with Angular
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `<h1>Hello, {{name}}</h1>`
})
export class AppComponent {
  name = 'Angular';
}
```

## State Management
### Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with React but also available for other frameworks.

#### Basic Redux Example
```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';

function counter(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

let store = createStore(counter);

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
```

### VueX
VueX is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications.

#### Basic VueX Example
```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

Vue.use(Vuex);

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++;
    }
  }
});

store.commit('increment');
console.log(store.state.count);
```

## Coding Examples
Each section includes practical coding examples to help you understand how to implement specific features or solve common problems using modern JavaScript and frameworks.
